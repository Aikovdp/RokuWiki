# Roleplay Discord Bot


!!! note inline end
    You are not required to use this bot when roleplaying on Discord, it's completely optional.

Currently all our nation Discord servers use the **Jinkaku** bot for roleplaying as your characters. Here's a walk-through on how to use it to set up a character and speak as them! 


## Creating a Character

The bot uses `rp!` as its prefix for every command. To create a new character, go to the designated `#bot-commands` channel and type `rp!create` followed by your character's name.

!!! example
    If I wanted to make a character named 'Roleplay Tutorial', I would type `rp!create Roleplay Tutorial`.


## Character Profile Customisation

Now that you've set-up a character with your desired name, it's time for you to begin personalising it! Type `rp!cmds profile` to see a list of all the commands related to character profiles. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on fully personalising your character's profile:

1. Whenever you make edits, you first need to select the character you want. You can do this by typing `rp!select`, followed by the number of your character. The bot will show you which number your character is.    

2. Now we can add the information to the profile. All the following options are optional though, they don't have to be added.
    - **Age:** To set your character's age, type `rp!age` followed by your character's age.
    - **Gender:** To set your character's gender, type `rp!gender` followed by your character's gender.
    - **Sexuality:** To set your character's sexuality, type `rp!sexuality` followed by your character's sexuality.
    - **Description:** To set a character description, type `rp!desc` followed by your character's description.

    !!! example
        - **Age:** If my character was 25, I would type `rp!age 25`.
        - **Gender:** If my character was non-binary, I would type `rp!gender Non-Binary`
        - **Sexuality:** If my character was undetermined about their sexuality, I would type `rp!sexuality Undetermined`
        - **Description:** If my character was a roleplay tutorial bot, I would type `rp!desc I am roleplay, here to assist you!`


## Character Set-Up

Once you have added the information you wanted to your character profile, you are able to set-up the finishing features!

- **Avatar:** Adding a character avatar is highly recommended, as when you speak as your character it will act as its profile picture. To add an avatar, you need to have a picture of your character. You can use our <a href="https://www.rokucraft.com/forum/m/24336306/viewthread/33082915-character-visualization" target="_blank">character visualisation</a> page to help with that. Once you have an image, add it as an attachment and type `rp!avatar`. This will set your character's avatar to the picture you attached.
- **Colour:** You are able to add a strip of colour to your character profile if you want to. You can do this by typing `rp!colour`, followed by a <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/" target="_blank">hex triplet</a>.
- **Prefix:** This is **necessary** if you want to be able to speak as your character on the Discord channels. You can set this by typing `rp!prefix`, followed by the prefix you want to use. Type a character's prefix before your message for it to be sent as that character.

!!! example
    - **Colour:** If I wanted to make a red colour strip, I would type `rp!colour #FF0000`.
    - **Prefix:** If I wanted to use 'rpR' as my character's prefix, I would type `rp!prefix rpR`. Now if I type `rpR "Hello! Roleplay tutorial here!"` it will speak as my character. Check the examples below!


## Finished Example

I followed the examples in this tutorial and this is the character profile I created:

     width="600"></p>

So now, when I type `rpR "Hello! Roleplay tutorial here!"`, this is what it will look like!

     width="600"></p>

You can now do this with your own information and begin roleplaying as your original character on Discord!
