Go to one of the General Stores around the server, like in Harbor Town, and buy a bug net. A bug net costs Â¥50.

Once you've gotten a bug net you can travel around our server to find bugs. Bugs **only** spawn in the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation.

When you find a bug, make sure you have your bug net at the ready! Go up to the bug and click it with your bug net to catch it. The bug will drop on the floor and will be available to be picked up. Pick the bug up and head to one of the Bug Merchants around the server.

Upon arrival at the Bug Merchant, make sure you have all the bugs you want to sell in your inventory. Talk to the Bug Merchant and a menu will open. In this menu, you will be able to select the bugs you want to sell.
