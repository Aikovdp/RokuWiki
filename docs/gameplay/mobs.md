In this menu you will be able to see a variety of mobs our server has, along with the difficulty of each mob. The more difficult the mob, the better reward! Select the mob you want to go hunt and you will be brought to their location.

Now the hunt begins! Get out your bending focus and begin fighting. When you kill mobs they will drop various loot items which can be sold to NPC's such as the Sheriff.
