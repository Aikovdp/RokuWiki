## Channels

Our chat system has a lot of different channels with different uses. Here's a list of useful channels:

### General Channels
*Anyone can use these channels:*

* **Global / G** - This channel is for general chatting amongst everyone on the server.

* **Local / L** - This channel is for speaking to people near you. Only players within a certain radius will see these messages.

* **Trading / TR** - This channel is for trading; use it when telling people you are buying or selling something.

* **Roleplay / RP** - This channel is for roleplay. It is localised so only people in a certain radius will be able to see these messages. To avoid confusion, make sure to only use this for roleplaying, not general chatting.
