To select a pet, click the relevant egg. Clicking the egg will spawn the pet.

Some pets have customisation options. To access the Pet Data Menu, right-click your pet. You'll see a menu with customisation options which you can use to make your pet a baby, change its colour and more! Not all pets have all these options though!

Once you've fully customised your pet you can save it. There are two ways to do this: one way is by using `/pet saves`, and the other way is by clicking the golden chest in the `/pets` menu. This will open the Pet Saves Menu where you can select from all your saves and create more saves.

Certain pets have to be opened via a different menu. To open this, click the book in the `/pets` menu. This will open a different menu that looks like this, where you'll be able to select your pet and customise it.
