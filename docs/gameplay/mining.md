Head to Harbor Town and speak to the Coachman, then choose either **Khuga** or **Plains Village**. If it's your first time we recommend you visit Khuga so that you can follow along with the tutorial written here.

We recommend you go find the Veteran Miner in the mine shop who will teach you the core mechanics of our mining system.

If you don't have any supplies you can talk to the Mining Supplies NPC where you will be able to buy supplies through a menu.

Now that you are all stocked up, it's time to head to one of the mines and begin digging for ores and gems!

When you mine a gem it will be uncut, but gems are worth much more money if they are cut! To cut one, head to the crafting station in the mine shop. You need to have a certain crafter level to cut rarer, and you can earn crafter levels by cutting gems. You can view your miner, smith and crafter levels using `/jobs stats`.

!!! tip
        If your crafter level isn't high enough to cut certain gems, you are able to keep them for later or sell them uncut to the Miner for less profit.

The gems you have cut at the crafter station can be sold to the Jeweller. To sell them, right click the jeweller and select the gems you want to sell in the menu.

Once you get some ore you'll need to smelt it to make it worth something. Go to the Smelting Station with your ores and some coal to turn your ores into ingots. You need to have a specific miner level to be able to get rare ores and you need a specific smith level to be able to smelt certain ores.

With your newly smelted ingots and some sticks you'll be able to create your own tools! Go to the Smithing Station and see what you can craft with your smith levels.
