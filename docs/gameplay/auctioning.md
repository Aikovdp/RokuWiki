In Harbor Town you will be able to find the Auction House on the left side of the docks.

Go on inside and read the signs; these will tell you what can be sold and what can't. Auctioning off an item is easy: You can use `/sell` to put an item up for sale, and `/bid` to put up items for bidding.

If you are interested in buying something from the auction house, talk the Auction Clerk. In the menu you'll see what items players are selling along with their prices. You can buy these items by clicking the item you want and then confirming your purchase.
