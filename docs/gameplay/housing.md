The best place to start is to visit the Basic Commands area in `/info`. That will teach you a few of the commands our housing system has to offer. One of the most useful commands to know when beginning is `/arm help`, as that will list all available housing commands.

The next step is extremely fun! Start saving money and go exploring around the server to find the perfect house for yourself. Once you find one, check it out to make sure it's the one you want to buy.

If you have enough money to pay the rent and have settled on the house you want, it's time to purchase! Walk up to the housing sign and right-click it to buy it. Alternatively, you can run `/arm buy` when standing in the region you want to buy. You will be able to see the time you have rented your house for. Please note that the date is formatted as `DD-MM-YYYY`.

Now that you have bought the house you will be able to see it under 'My Regions (Owner)' in you `/arm gui`. This will tell you how much time you have left to renew your rent and if you click the region, you will be able to access more information about it.

Amongst this extra information about your house there will be an option to sell your house. This can also be done through `/arm sell`. It's important to remember any blocks left in the house will not go into your inventory and will be deleted instead, so make sure you store all the blocks you want to keep when thinking about selling your house.

Now, you might be wondering where you get the blocks to decorate your house. Here's the answer! There are a number of block shops throughout the world, one of which can be found at spawn. Click the Block Shop NPC to open the menu which allows you to purchase a wide variety of blocks!
