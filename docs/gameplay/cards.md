Use `/vote` to open the voting menu. In this menu you can see how to vote for our server. Each time you vote for our server, you will get rewarded with a voting point. These voting points can be used in the Vote Shop.

In the Vote Shop you can decide which card booster pack you want; you can choose one from *Avatar: The Last Airbender* or one from *The Legend of Korra*. Each booster pack costs 6 voting points.

Hold and right-click the booster pack to get a card. The card you get will be assigned a certain rarity. You can click the card if you want to store it in your collection. Alternatively, you could sell it to other players or even put it in the Auction House!

To view your collected cards, you can use the `/cards` command. Pick the collection you want to view, and you will be able to see all the cards you own in that collection. If you want to get a card back into your inventory, you can simply click it in the collection menu. You can then once again display it in item frames or sell it to others!
