Go to the Harbor Town School and head up the stairs to meet the Art Teacher.

Once you find the Art Teacher, click him to be brought to the Art Class.

In the Art Class there will be options available for you to buy a canvas (right) to begin. You will also be able to buy an Art Copier (left) to make copies of your final product later on.

Place your new canvas on one of the easels and right-click it to sit down and begin painting. You can access our variety of paints and tools in your inventory

Now it's time to begin painting onto the canvas! To paint, click the canvas with different colours. Right-click and drag to draw lines and curves. You can also click with a Paint Bucket and a colour in your offhand to fill in an area. If you mess up or want to restart, you can run `/artmap clear` while painting!

When you are finished and happy with your painting, you have two options to save it. You can either use `/artmap save <title>`, or use the canvas saving tool that's in your inventory. If you want to use spaces in the title, surround it with quotation marks ("like this").

Now that you have made a painting you can make copies of it to sell or place in an item frame. You can make copies by combining your painting with an Art Copier bought at the Art Class.
