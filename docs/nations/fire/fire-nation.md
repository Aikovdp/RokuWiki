# The Fire Nation Lore

Historically, the Fire Nation has been known as violent conquerors of the world, evident in the genocide of the Air Nomads and plans to scorch the Earth Kingdom. However, after the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation blossomed into a peaceful and benevolent population. This trend has continued for the most part in modern times.

The Fire Nation consists of hundreds of islands of differing size with many cities and villages located on volcanic islands - the Fire Nation Capital resides within a dormant volcano! The Fire Nation has withdrawn from most colonies in the Earth Kingdom, but a few remain on their land, leading to a mix of the two nations' citizens creating ethnically diverse towns.

## Culture

While the Fire Nation itself has changed immensely, its culture is relatively the same. Values such as honour and respect are significant to Firebenders and must be shown towards the elderly and nobles. Although Agni Kais to the death are outlawed, duels for honour are still common today. 

Appearance is crucial in the Fire Nation. Nobility and high ranking officials often dress in precious cloth and armour made with the finest metal lined with gold. In addition, most sacred Fire Nation buildings are pagoda-like and sport the Fire Nation symbol and a picture of the Fire Lord.

Fire Nation cuisine often has some sort of spice in it, including regular dishes, festival food, and tea. Also, due to the Fire Nation's rocky and mountainous terrain, pastures for animals are much more common than land for farming, meaning that Fire Nation cuisine regularly has meat. 

Fire Nation festivals tend to have fun activities, plays and an assortment of food for all people to enjoy. A few of the most popular attractions include the Fire Days Festival, Fire Nation Circus and Fire Lily Festivals.

## Government

Previously, the Fire Nation was ruled by a council of Fire Sages and focused on philosophy and spirituality. The council leader was called the Fire Lord but eventually broke off from the group and became the sole ruler of the nation. The government of the Fire Nation is a partial monarchy, with the Fire Lord and their cabinet overseeing the nation. The cabinet consists of the Royal Secretariat, Prime Minister, High Magistrate, High Sage and Lord. During the days of the Hundred Year War, the Fire Sages pledged their loyalty to the Fire Lord. However, after the end of the war, they once again pledged their loyalty to the Avatar whilst remaining to be the religious authority of the nation. 

During the Hundred Year War, the Fire Nation took control of regions across the Earth Kingdom and maintain jurisdiction over these territories today. Although, in an effort to achieve peace, there has been a reduction in the number of Fire Nation controlled towns.

## Present

During Fire Lord Ryuu Ozaki's reign, the Fire Nation flourished under her peaceful rule for a short while. However, crime slowly began to increase in which danger felt ever present to the people of the Fire Nation. Fire Lord Ryuu Ozaki felt that it was essential for her to return to her roots, so it was critical for her to find a successor that would have the potential to return the Fire Nation to its once thriving state. Her cousin, Xelin Ozaki, was selected to be her successor and was crowned at Coronation Plaza, in the Fire Nation Capital. The criminal organisations are yet to be eliminated; however, this remains to be Fire Lord Xelin Ozaki's number one priority. He wishes to rule over a harmonious and blossoming Fire Nation that the other nations may view as an ally.

## History

### Fire Lord Seb
After the Hundred Year War, Fire Lord Seb was crowned. He would attempt to change the previously observed, vicious and violent Fire Nation and contribute to an era of peace. 

### The Air Temple Restoration Agreement (ATRA)
Along with the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the Fire Nation signed the Air Temple Restoration Agreement to help restore the Air Temples that Sozin destroyed. The agreement outlined that the Fire Nation would provide the resources for rebuilding and would assist with the reconstruction. As a result, the Eastern Air Temple, Southern Air Temple, Western Air Temple have already been restored.

### The Rebel War
The Fire Nation was one of the two main opposing sides in the Rebel War. It was first provoked by an attempted assassination at the Ember Island theatre. The Fire Nation and Water Tribe then launched numerous attacks against one another. Although, due to the death of Princess Tae and the unveiling Spiritual Shaman, Justin, a peace treaty was signed, bringing a sense of unity to the two nations and ending the war.

### The Third War
Once again dragged into another war, the Earth Kingdom accused the Fire Lord and his ex-advisor, Xaon, of kidnapping and torturing Queen Kyo's daughter, Princess Hana. However, it was then revealed that this rumour was false and that it was the Red Lotus who had framed the Fire Nation. For most of the war, the Fire Nation responded defensively, aside from their last attack upon Fong's Fortress, which would end the war. 

### Fire Lord Ryuu
Even after Fire Lord Seb's attempts to maintain peace, two wars broke out during his rule. After reflection, he decided to give up his throne to another firebender to bring fresh eyes and ideas to the nation. As his only son disappeared and didn't have any other heir, he gave the throne to War Minister Ryuu Ozaki. She was crowned the new Fire Lord and immediately took steps to appoint a Cabinet to aid her in making better decisions for the Fire Nation.


### Fire Lord Xelin
In 126 AG, after a period of peace, the leadership of the Fire Nation was passed onto the former Higher Magistrate, Xelin Ozaki. He would attempt to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor and cousin, Ryuu Ozaki. Unfortunately, there was an increase in criminal activity encountered during his reign, which he successfully eliminated with the assistance of the Cabinet and his military.
