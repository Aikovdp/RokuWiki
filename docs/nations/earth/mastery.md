title: Earthbending Mastery

# Earthbending

Earth is the element of substance, if you want to be able to control it and bend it to your will you need a great deal of strength, durability and endurance. Earthbenders should seek to master the art of creating powerful stances in order to provide their body and mind with the essential stability and stamina required of a skilled bender. Unlike other elements, earthbending prospers when the bender waits and listens for the precise moment to attack. Those who are well versed in bending the element will learn to endure attacks until the perfect opportunity to counterattack reveals itself to them.

## Mastery

Mastery is divided into 4 tiers which cover earthbending techniques of varying difficulty. The system is designed so that players do not always have to be taught by masters in order to advance. This way players can help each other learn without the need for a master to be available at all times.

Outlined below are the moves and number of trainings associated with each tier. Your teacher will have a detailed guide that specifies how many lessons, sparring matches and/or solo trainings each move requires.

            You must learn **3 out of 8** master level moves listed in order to apply for mastery. If your current master does not know the move(s) you have chosen to learn then you will have to learn it solo, which will take more time.

## Earthbending Roleplay Tips

Earthbending is based on the Hung Gar style of kung fu. If you’re looking for ways to improve your earthbending roleplay you could do some research on it. Learning about the earthbending influences may help you to more accurately describe stances and moves when roleplaying.
